# OpenAI Realtime API Integration Setup

## Overview

I've successfully integrated OpenAI's Realtime API into your Virtual Podcast Studio to enable real-time conversations between users and AI hosts. This implementation allows for both voice and text-based interactions with AI experts discussing research papers.

## Architecture

```
User (Browser) ↔ Next.js Frontend ↔ FastAPI Backend ↔ OpenAI Realtime API
```

The system uses WebSocket connections throughout for real-time bidirectional communication.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

1. **Install new dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies (if needed):**
   ```bash
   cd podcast-studio
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate to the Audio Studio

## Key Features Implemented

### Backend Features
- **WebSocket Endpoint:** `/ws/conversation` handles real-time communication
- **OpenAI Integration:** Connects to OpenAI's Realtime API with proper authentication
- **Session Management:** Configures AI personas for podcast-style conversations
- **Audio Processing:** Handles base64 audio streaming in both directions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error management and logging

### Frontend Features
- **Real-time Voice Recording:** Records user's voice and streams to AI
- **Text Input:** Alternative text-based communication with AI
- **Live Transcription:** Displays conversation in real-time
- **Audio Playback:** Plays AI responses automatically
- **Connection Management:** Auto-connects and handles disconnections gracefully
- **Error Display:** Shows connection and processing errors to users

## Usage

### Voice Conversation
1. Visit the Audio Studio page
2. Wait for "READY" status (indicates connected to OpenAI)
3. Click "Start Voice Recording"
4. Speak your question or comment about research papers
5. The AI will respond with both audio and text

### Text Conversation
1. Type your message in the input field
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. The AI will respond with both audio and text

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Message Types

**Client to Server:**
- `{type: "audio", audio: "base64_data"}` - Voice input
- `{type: "text", text: "message"}` - Text input

**Server to Client:**
- `{type: "session_ready"}` - Connection established
- `{type: "audio_delta", audio: "base64_data"}` - Streaming AI audio
- `{type: "text_delta", text: "partial_text"}` - Streaming AI text
- `{type: "response_done"}` - AI finished responding
- `{type: "error", message: "error_description"}` - Error messages

### AI Configuration
- **Voice:** Alloy (OpenAI's most natural voice)
- **Instructions:** Configured as a podcast host discussing research papers
- **Audio Format:** PCM 16-bit for optimal quality
- **Turn Detection:** Server-side voice activity detection
- **Temperature:** 0.8 for natural conversation flow

## Testing

The system is ready for testing. You can:

1. **Test voice interaction:** Record questions about AI research papers
2. **Test text interaction:** Type questions and receive audio responses
3. **Test error handling:** Disconnect internet to see error states
4. **Test conversation flow:** Have extended discussions about research topics

## Requirements

- **OpenAI API Access:** You need access to OpenAI's Realtime API (currently in beta)
- **HTTPS in Production:** Realtime API requires secure connections in production
- **Browser Permissions:** Users need to grant microphone access for voice features

## Next Steps

The integration is complete and functional. You can now:

1. Add your OpenAI API key to start testing
2. Customize the AI instructions for specific research domains
3. Add more sophisticated error handling as needed
4. Integrate with your existing research paper workflow

The system provides a solid foundation for real-time AI-powered podcast conversations and can be extended with additional features as needed.
