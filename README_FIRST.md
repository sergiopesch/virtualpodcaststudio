## ⚠️ One Required Action

**You need to configure your OpenAI API key:**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here" > .env

# Frontend  
cd ../podcast-studio
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here" > .env.local
```

Replace `sk-your-actual-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Not Blocking Deployment)

1. **Deprecated Audio API** (Medium Priority)
   - Uses `ScriptProcessorNode` (deprecated but works fine)
   - Recommend: Replace with `AudioWorkletNode` in next update
   - Impact: None currently, works in all browsers

2. **No Automated Tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Manual testing required
   - Recommend: Add unit/integration/e2e tests
   - Workaround: Use TESTING_CHECKLIST.md

3. **Unused Backend Code** (Low Priority)
   - Backend has unused WebSocket endpoint
   - Recommend: Remove or document purpose
   - Impact: None (just extra code)
